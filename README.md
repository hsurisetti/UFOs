## Summary
Finally, this webpage has been successfully bulit using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

### Drawback :
  Some drawbacks which I could notice are 
   - If the user doesn't know the exact date but knows the month that needs to be searched upon, the user cannot search specifically for that month. The user needs to know the eact full date.
   - Some shapes like 'formation', 'light' , 'fireball' are counter-intutive .
   - Exact spacing needs to be given and cannot include spaces in the end and case sensitive which is user specific issue.


### Recommendations :
My recommendations would be to
 - Provide a data range which looks for all the data within that range if the user wants to look for any months of data
 - Trim the user entered value to remove the spaces at the end and make it case insensitive which my opinion is a cosmetic change instead of design which would be nice to have feature.
 - Provide a drop-down option for the list of shapes which given the user with the option of different shapes which user can select from.
